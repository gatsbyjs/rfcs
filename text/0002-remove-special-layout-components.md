# Summary

Gatsby v1 includes a special "layout" component that can wrap page components.
This RFC proposes removing it and encouraging people to use normal React
component composition.

[Previous discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/3830)

# Basic example

Currently sites might have a global layout components like:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <div>Global navigation</div>
    {children()}
  </div>
)
```

After this RFC is implemented, people would import the same component into each
page component e.g.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

export default ({ props }) => (
  <Layout>
    <div>Hello world</div>
  </Layout>
)
```

# Motivation

There are several motivations for eliminating the special layout component:

* It's frequently confusing to people used to React as it breaks the normal component composition model
* It has a number of limitations e.g. we don't support multiple levels of layouts e.g. a global header and footer and then on some pages, a sidebar menu. Currently you have to stuff both levels into a single layout component with a lot of
conditional logic keyed to pathnames.
* Communicating between the layout and page components is non-standard and hard to understand
* It significantly complicates Gatsby's codebase and client runtime
* It reduces the effectiveness of our new code splitting setup in Gatsby v2 and prevents some potential code splitting/loading improvements
* It makes Gatsby page transitions work oddly compared to normal React and relatively
difficult to do well

So it short, it complicates learning and using Gatsby for users as well as
maintaining our codebase for maintainers — all for no benefit over using normal
React components. Many people report that they didn't realize the special
layout components existed so they followed the proposed pattern of creating
a layout component which they imported into pages. We should be very wary whenever
we realize we've badly reimplemented a basic React pattern :-)

# Detailed design

V1 layout components are normal components in all respect *except* they, like
page components, can query for data. People sometimes use this to query data in
layouts like the site title, etc. for setting site metadata with react-helmet.

Since migrated layout components won't be able to include queries in the
existing form, I propose adding support to components for "static queries",
or queries that don't take arguments.

During the planning stages of Gatsby, I considered adding something similar to
this so that people could query data into any component. Ultimately I decided
against this as a very common use case for querying is "page template"
components e.g. a component for blog posts. The query for this page component
would need to accept variables e.g. the id of the markdown file that's being
shown on that page.

When we added the layout component, we reused the same graphql syntax and
pattern as they too needed to include queries.

For static queries in v2 layout components, I propose the following pattern:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Helmet from 'react-helmet'
import { StaticQuery } from 'gatsby'

export default class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
  render () {
    <StaticQuery
      query={graphql`
        {
           site {
             siteMetadata {
               title
             }
           }
       }
      `}
      render={staticData => (
        <div>
          <Helmet title={staticData.site.siteMetadata.title} />
          <h1>Welcome to {staticData.site.siteMetadata.title}!</h1>
          <p>We hope your stay is pleasant.</p>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  }
}
```

Just like with our current GraphQL implementation, we'd extract the graphql
queries and run them for you. You'd be able to use fragments, etc. The only
difference is you can't pass arguments to the query (hence the name,
`StaticQuery` :-)).

During development, we'd hot-reload changes to the query & underlying data.

Then in production, we'd do a cool optimization. We'd have a babel plugin which
compiles the above into something that looks like:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Helmet from 'react-helmet'
import { StaticData } from 'gatsby'
import staticData12513 from './staticData12513'

export default class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
  render () {
    <StaticQuery
      data={staticData12513}
      render={staticData => (
        <div>
          <Helmet title={staticData.site.siteMetadata.title} />
          <h1>Welcome to {staticData.site.siteMetadata.title}!</h1>
          <p>We hope your stay is pleasant.</p>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  }
}
```

There's now a little packet of JSON attached to the component! Also, the static file name would be a hash of the query so on the off-chance you reuse a query, webpack 4 would split out the query result module into a new chunk that's shared between components.

It'll also enable new types of components that you can now attach not just markup, styles, and interactivity, but also bits of data. E.g. imagine an SEO component that queries standard data + you can pass in page specific data as well. Or a team member avatar component that has queried the name + image of the 10 team members so you can drop in the component anywhere it's needed. Or a product preview that you can manually add throughout the site as needed. Or a menu component.

# Drawbacks

* Requires implementing the new StaticQuery feature — which isn't trivial — and means
 more code to maintain.
* It's a breaking change so we'd need to educate existing users of layouts who'll need to migrate v1 sites.
 This could involve inventing new patterns to handle more complex cases like
 i18n

# Alternatives

Keep things as they are. It's not a terrible alternative. Layouts as they exist
are mediocre but get the job done more-or-less.

# Adoption strategy

* Add how to update to the v2 migration guide
* Update any relevant docs/tutorials

Fortunately it's very easy to migrate to this new setup. Most people
can just leave their existing layout component as is (other than making
`children` a normal prop instead of a function) and import it into their
pages and make it the top-most component there.

# How we teach this

For layouts, there's nothing to teach as it's just normal React now. Probably
will want some guides around more sophisticated patterns e.g. i18n.

For `<StaticQuery>`, we'll add documentation to the tutorial + our GraphQL
concepts page.
