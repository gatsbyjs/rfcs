# Summary

Wishlist for the next major version of Gatsby

# Basic example

*We have not started work on the next major version of Gatsby, and there is no timeline for when weâ€™ll start, or when it will be available.*

This rfc is intended to collect any breaking changes that might require a major version before they can be implemented. Nothing on here is guaranteed to happen.

When we get closer to working on these changes, this issue will probably be closed and split out into separate issues.

- use Webpack 5
- set `loose: false` in `babel-preset-gatsby`
- React v16.7/8 min support (for suspense)
- page context shape in graphql
- inference default behaviour for createTypes

# Motivation

We want to batch any breaking changes into a major version release. This is a place to keep track of what those changes _might_ be.
